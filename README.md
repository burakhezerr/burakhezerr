### Hi there! I'm Burak, a DevOps Engineer

I am a highly dedicated and solutions-oriented **DevOps Engineer**, with a passion for transforming manual, error-prone workflows into efficient, automated processes that enable engineering teams to focus on innovation. My expertise spans a diverse range of technologies, but my core focus remains on creating scalable, resilient, and secure cloud infrastructure that meets the modern demands of high-availability applications.

#### What I’m working on:
Currently, I specialize in the orchestration and automation of **cloud-native infrastructure** leveraging tools like **Kubernetes** for container management and **Terraform** for infrastructure-as-code (IaC). My primary focus is on enabling seamless, continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) pipelines that deliver robust, production-ready applications efficiently and reliably.

#### Constantly Learning:
My technical foundation includes deep expertise in **C++**, **Python**, and **Java**, but I am always expanding my skill set to stay ahead of the technological curve. I'm particularly driven by a desire to master cutting-edge technologies, such as advanced container orchestration techniques, multi-cloud architectures, and cloud security best practices. DevOps is not just a role but a mindset of **continuous improvement** and adaptability.

#### Tech Stack & Expertise:
My daily toolkit includes a combination of modern programming languages, infrastructure management tools, and cloud services:
- **Languages:** C++, Python, Java
- **Infrastructure Management:** Kubernetes, Terraform, Docker
- **Cloud Providers:** AWS (with extensive experience in multi-account setups, VPC design, IAM policies, and more)
- **Monitoring & Logging:** Prometheus, Grafana (to maintain observability across distributed systems)
- **Security:** Cloud security is a major priority; I’ve worked on designing secure networking policies, integrating security into CI/CD pipelines, and adhering to industry compliance standards.

#### Currently Employed:
In my current role as a **DevOps Engineer**, I collaborate with cross-functional teams to enhance automation, streamline operations, and drive continuous improvement across cloud infrastructures.

#### Ask me about:
- Optimizing **Kubernetes clusters** for scalability and fault tolerance
- Automating infrastructure deployment using **Terraform**
- Building secure, high-performance **CI/CD pipelines**
- Best practices in **cloud-native DevOps** and **cloud security**

#### How to reach me:
Let’s discuss how to build innovative solutions that push the boundaries of cloud infrastructure and DevOps practices.
